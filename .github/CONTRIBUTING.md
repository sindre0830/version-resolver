# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Please follow these steps to ensure a smooth contribution process.

---

## 1. Create an Issue

- Before you start working on any changes, **create an issue** in the repository describing the feature, bug, or improvement you want to address.
- Clearly indicate in the issue that you would like to work on it.
- Wait for a response from a developer to ensure your contribution aligns with the project's needs.

> **Note**: You are welcome to proceed with creating a pull request without explicit developer approval, but be aware that this comes with the risk of the pull request not being merged if the changes are deemed unnecessary or misaligned with the project goals.

---

## 2. Fork and Make Changes

- Fork this repository to your GitHub account and make the changes.
- If your changes impact the functionality described in the `README.md`, make sure to update it accordingly.
- For any new functionality, ensure that you write appropriate tests to maintain the project's stability.

---

## 3. Create a Pull Request (PR)

- Once your changes are complete, create a pull request from your fork to the main repository.
- In the **PR description**, include the phrase `Resolves #ISSUE_NUMBER` to link your PR to the corresponding issue. Replace `ISSUE_NUMBER` with the actual issue number.

### 3.1 PR Title Guidelines

Prefix your PR title with one of the following:

- `feat`: For new features or functionality.
- `fix`: For bug fixes.
- `refactor`: For code refactoring.
- `chore`: For small tasks or maintenance updates.
- `docs`: For documentation updates.

> **Note**: If multiple prefixes apply (e.g., both `feat` and `docs`), use the most significant prefix. For example, use `feat` in this case.

### 3.2 Description for Large PRs

- If your PR modifies more than **100 lines**, include a short summary of the changes made.
